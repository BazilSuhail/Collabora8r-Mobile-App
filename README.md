## Collabora8r (Project Management Tool)
A project collaboration tool I built using MERN stack aiming to craft a full stack web application which enhances team collaboration, streamlines task management and assignment, and track project progress efficiently ensuring seamless communication, workflow and improvement in productivity.


This is the client-side of the project, built using React to create a dynamic and responsive user interface along with react supported technologies/ kits. 
- The useContext API of react is leveraged for state management across various components, enabling smooth data flow and simplifying the handling of shared state. 
- Socket.IO Client is integrated to enable real-time communication, allowing instant notifications and updates for team members. For enhanced animations and smooth transitions.
- Framer Motion is utilized, ensuring a polished and engaging user experience throughout the application. 

These technologies combine to create an interactive and seamless interface for effective project collaboration.
